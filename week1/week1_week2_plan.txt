WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Hang Gao]
Date: [06/02/2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
Some body_mass_mg are negative, which is biologically impossible.

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
Tutorial 7 - 7.0.7 Cross-variable checks: Biological impossibilities

Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
body_mass_mg

Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
Negative mass effect statistical analysis.

What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
Identify negative values and convert them to NA or investigate whether they are data entry errors


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
Treatment has inconsistent capital letters

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
Tutorial 1 - checking strings

Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
Treatment

Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
Inconsistent labels may cause errors.

What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
tandardize treatment names using string formatting (e.g. converting to lowercase).


OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - missing values in collector column]
- [Issue 4 - some missing numeric values (eggs_laid, eggs_hatched)]
- [Issue 5 - Date range beck may be needed but it seems already appear formatted correctly.]


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Should negative body_mass values be removed or converted to NA?

2. How to determine if missing values are random or systematic?

3.Best practice for handling repeated female_id if repeated measures exist.
